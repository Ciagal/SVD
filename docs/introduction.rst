Introduction
============

The purpose of this project is to implement the Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) algorithm without using built-in SVD functions.

The implementation is tested on synthetic low-rank matrices and compared
with scikit-learn's randomized SVD.

Main goals:
-----------
- implement SVD from scratch
- verify correctness using reconstruction error
- compare results with scikit-learn
